        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>MarinerX was founded with a vision to develop innovative and practical solutions for boat owners. Our goal is to enhance the longevity and performance of boats by tackling common problems with effective, well-engineered products.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>MarinerX started as a passion project, combining a love for sailing and hands-on engineering. Our first product, the <strong>MarinerX Hull Dryer</strong>, was designed to address the issue of trapped moisture in boat hulls, helping owners prevent damage and maintain peak performance.</p>
        
        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>We create products that solve real problems for boat owners. Our current focus is on moisture management, but we are constantly exploring new innovations that improve the boating experience.</p>
        
        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>We’re committed to growing MarinerX with more innovative products tailored for sailors and boaters. We welcome feedback and ideas—let us know what challenges you face, and we’ll work to develop solutions.</p>
